No Ingame or Discord talk about, Religion or Politics. (We understand everyone has their own view points, and opinions, but do try to keep text and talk game related.)\n\n2. No Racist/Sexist/Homophobic slurs or hate speech. (We have a zero tolerance policy for the aforementioned, you will be removed from Discord as well as the Cluster.)\n\n3. No Pillar/Foundation spam, unless building in that location within a three day period. (This is to allow current and future community members to have many options as to where and what they can build.)\n\n4. Play fair (No use of exploits/meshing) and be kind to your fellow community members. (You may need their help one day, so keep it respectful.)\n\n5. If there are dinos up for claim, claim them and then post in lost and found to the owner/tribe name and if within 24 hours no one replies they are yours to keep. Be respectful of others schedules and give them a chance to reclaim their dinos.\n\n6. If you win a lottery or donate, it is YOUR job to contact an admin to get your reward delivery set up.",
